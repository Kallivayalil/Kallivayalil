                <b>Preliminary Notes</b>
                <ol class="ItalicsText">
                    <li><b>'Kallivayalil'</b> is not really our family name. It is only a name accidentally
                        acquired in the recent past. We actually belong to the "Kokattu" family of the Bharananganam
                        parish, where the earliest known residential site of the family is situated on the
                        North bank of the Meenachil River, just below the Vilangupara in the river bed,
                        over which now stands the new bridge. Where they came from, when and how, are now
                        matters of mere conjecture.</li>
                    <li><b>'Kallivayalil'</b> was actually a few acres of flat virgin forest land, with
                        a thick undergrowth of thorny wild cactus plants, named locally as 'kally'. This
                        plot on the west bank of the Ponnozhukum Thodu, and north of the Thonipara valary
                        which flowed into the said thodu. Because of the impenetrable cactus growth, the
                        place came to be called 'Kallvayal'. Even during the 1920's we could see a few surviving
                        cactus plants along the boundary kaiyala of the present Kallivayalil parampu.</li>
                </ol>
                Towards the middle of the 18th century, near about 1750, one Ittyavira was the 'Paterfamilias'
                of the Kokattu family. Very little is known about him, except that he was blessed
                with several sons and daughters and that he had a brother who was a priest in the
                church. We can guess that he had other brothers and some uncles also from the fact
                that several members of the Kokattu family emigrated to settle down in and about
                the Vilakumadom area. One of the sons of this Ittyavira, is also known to have gone
                as adopted to Ipenparampilkunnel in Pravithanam.
                <br />
                <br />
                The eldest son of Itttyavira, named Chacko, married Mariamma the daughter of Punnoose
                of Kizhakethalakal in Kanjirapally. After they had two or three children, getting
                their of ancestral properties, they shifted to Vilakumadom to live separately. Here
                they cleared the cactus jungle west of the thodu and put up their new house there.
                The exact location was just in front of Varkiachan's present house, where a small
                mount of earth was pointed out by our elders even in the 1920's as the site of the
                first house. This great-grand-father Chacko may be considered theprgenitor of the
                Kallivayalil group of the Kokattu family.<br />
                <br />
                This Chacko and Mariamma had two sons and five daughters. The daughters were married
                to (1) Vallocherry, (2) Kudakachira, (3) Vaimattom, (4) Puthiyadathu and (5) Arkattu
                families. Of these the Vallocherry daughter died after the birth of a son. That
                child was brought up by grand-father Chacko and got settled in Vilakumadom itself
                – our Karunattu Perappan. The two sons were (1) Ittyavira, bearing the name of his
                paternal grand-father, and (2) Punnoose, the name sake of his maternal grand-father,
                of Kizhakethalakal. Punnoose Valiappan married from Tharapel (Bharananganam), and
                although they lived to a ripe old age, died without any issues.
                <br />
                <br />
                The senior, Ittyavira Valiappan has an unusual record of four marriages in succession
                and has children in all four of them.
                <ol>
                    <li>From Pulikiyil of Aruvithara: She died after the birth of a daughter who was married
                        to Vayalil (Palai) to be the great-grand-mother of Bishop Sebastian Vayalil.</li>
                    <li>From Kottkapallil of Palai: She also died after the birth of a daughter who was
                        married to Thayil Family of Mannanam.</li>
                    <li>From Uppummakel of Kadanad : She bore him a son and a daughter. That son was Chacko
                        (Kondooparampil Perappan), the father of K.C. Abraham (Pappan Chettan). The daughter
                        was married to Olikal family to become the mother of KunjuDevasia and Kunjittyavia
                        of Kozhipoovananikal.</li>
                    <li>From Kottathu in Arakuzha-Karakunnon parish: She was Annamma and this was her second
                        marriage. She had a daughter by her first marriage, who was adopted by Ittyavira
                        and taken home with her mother. She was brought up here and was married to Pathrose
                        of Mundattuchundayil (Edamattom) – Karimaruthumkunnel Peramma.</li>
                </ol>
                This Annammma Valiamma gave birth to two sons and one daughter. The elder son was
                Michael and the one was Joseph. The girl Thresiamma was the youngest. She was married
                to Kuruvilla Kochu Thomman of Kuruvinakunnel, but died without any issue.
                <br />
                <br />
                At the time when Ittyavira's son Chacko came to live in Vilakumadom, all the surrounding
                area was dark virgin forest, infested by all kinds of dangerous wildlife, such as
                elephants, tigers, leopards, wolves and boars. About a mile to the north there were
                a few high caste Nair families round about the Vilakumadom consisted one Christian
                family of Pazhoor, one Ezhava family of Chempankulam and a Nair tharavadu of Pendanam.
                To the south was a stretch of four miles of thick malarial forest up to Panamattam
                where a few Nairs lived around a Sastha temple.<br />
                <br />
                Some very elderly people have been heard to say that some paddy lands adjacent to
                the Kalli-Vayal was the patrimony of the priest uncle of Chacko and that he donated
                to his nephew out of consideration for his having to go to inhabit such a wilderness.<br />
                <br />
                Chacko's son Ittyavira constructed a new and more elaborate house in Anavalaril
                and shifted from their original one in the Kalli-vayal. He also put up a big new
                house at Kondooparambil for his eldest son Chacko, and later a more modern new house
                for his second son Michael near his first house in Kallivayal. Punnose Valiappan
                who had no children did not care to put up a separate house for himself, but continued
                to live with his brother.<br />
                <br />
                Although Chacko Valiappan initiated the idea,it was under the able guidance of the
                two brothers Ittyavira and Punnoose that a thatched shed church was put up in Vilakumadomin
                the name of St. John Nepomacene. Later on, by the time more people came to settle
                down in the area, they themselves took the initiative in building a bigger sturdier
                church with a very high bell tower. Somehow the new church was dedicated to St.
                Francis Xavier.
                <br />
                <br />
                Among other notable achievements of Ittyavira Valiappan, was the success of his
                venturesome land improvement schemes. The Ponnozhukum Thodu originally ran through
                the middle of the paddy lands. He managed to cut out a new bed for the river to
                flow along one of the fields to consolidate the area for more irrigation purposes.
                A number of Chira mukhams also were made along the river to make temporary dams
                to supply water to the fields durind dry spells. Besides, he acquired more lands
                for the family and pioneered several agricultural innovations. In all these, his
                brother Punnoose also was deeply involved.<br />
                <br />
                It is worth noting that neither Ittyavira nor his father Chacko ever used 'Kallivayalil'
                as their family name. In all their correspondence and documents, they identified
                themselves as so and so forth of Kokattu, residing in Kallivayalil (Kallivayalil
                thamasikum Kokattu). It was only the brothers Chacko, Michael and Joseph who started
                using Kallivayalil as their family name.
